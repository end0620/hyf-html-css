To create a hidden directory or a hidden file you just have to put the "." at the begin.
example:
mkdir .test -> will create a hidden directory 
touch .file -> will create a hidden file

To show the hidden file with the ls command in the terminal we only have to use the "-a" extension for the ls command. Example:
ls -a -> this will show all the files and directory in the current path, included the hidden files.


2)How to create multiple nested directories in one command
We just need to use de "-p" extension for the mkdir command. Example:

mkdir unmesh/these/folders/are/just/for/fun

3)echo "test" > fun
echo "another test" >> fun
wc -c fun

number of character: 18

4)to append something to a fila using echo without putting a end of line character we can use the "-n" extension of the command echo. Example:

echo -n "test" > fun
echo "another test" >> fun

cat fun = "testanother test"
