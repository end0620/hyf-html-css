					<h1>Best for Mobility: Nintendo Switch</h1>
					<p>Upon its first reveal, the Nintendo Switch marketed itself as a mobile gaming system that not only could be played at home on your television, but also carried around and playable wherever you go. Nintendo’s innovative console makes playing on the go easy and comes with a disassembling controller with split screen options, so you can play with friends.<br><br>

					 The Switch makes for a great system for parties with its mobile snap-off joy-con controllers – once out of its docking station, it acts like a tablet with its own dedicated screen that can be shared with others through split-screen multiplayer games.

					<h1>Best for Graphics: Xbox One X</h1>
					<p>The Xbox One X capitalizes on its former Xbox One model with some of the most powerful tech you’ll find in a gaming system today. If you’re looking to get the highest sense of realism from a current gaming console with the most powerful displays, the Xbox One X takes the cake.<br><br>

					 The Xbox One X contains six trillion floating point operations per second with 326GB/s and 12GB GDDR5 RAM, giving it the most graphical horsepower in rendering native 4K HD graphics at 60 frames per second. All Xbox One games are compatible and run better on the Xbox One X in Full HD display as well. Microsoft even plans on bringing Original Xbox and Xbox 360 backward compatibility to the system too.

					<h1>Best Value: Xbox 360 E Console</h1>
					<p>At just under $200, there’s no better current gaming console you can get than the Xbox 360. Though it has spanned multiple models, the Xbox 360 E console comes with all the essentials: a wireless controller, built-in Wi-Fi, and one month of Xbox LIVE Gold (its premium online service for shopping and online multiplayer).<br><br>

					Though it holds only 4GB, the Xbox 360 E console is expandable with an added on media hard drive up to 500 GB. The Xbox 360 E console is a nice staple in the current gaming console market, with over 1,200 Xbox 360 games in its library and counting, on-demand HD movies, TV streaming, as well as a built-in DVD player so gamers will never get bored. Though the Xbox 360 is nearing its lifespan on the current market, its latest model is a well-established updated version of its former self, bettering it in every way from reliability to price, and assuring a long life to come as a complete console.</p>

					<h1>Best for Games and Backward Compatibility: PlayStation 3</h1>
					<p>You won’t find backward compatibility with its newer slimmer version, but the PlayStation 3’s original launch models are backward compatible with your old PlayStation games. Players can play their PlayStation One and PlayStation 2 games on this PlayStation 3 (and there'll be upscale imaging on the high-definition TV screen without worry).<br><br>

					Doubling as a Blu-ray/DVD player with built-in Wi-Fi, the PlayStation 3 currently has a library of over 1,400 games. This is not including its playable PlayStation 2 library of 3,874 games and PlayStation One with 2,513. The versatile and current gaming console still packs a punch, delivering a powerful home entertainment system not only good for gaming, but video chat, Internet access, digital photo viewing and digital audio and video.</p>

					<h1>Best for Families: Nintendo Wii U</h1>
					<p>Nintendo’s been known as the flagship console that is the most kid-friendly, and the Wii U is no exception. Most of its gaming library contains an E rating for Everyone, and the games are often some of the most critically acclaimed for gameplay, art direction and just pure fun.<br><br>

					The Nintendo Wii U uses a gamepad controller with a screen in it, so if parents want to use the living room TV, kids can still play on their Wii U through its dedicated gaming screen without interference. It includes some of the most fun local multiplayer games, too, such as Mario Kart 8 and Super Mario 3D world – both capable of up to four players. The Wii U is also compatible with Wii remote controllers, so you don’t have to buy even more hardware to get in on the game with your friends and family.</p>
